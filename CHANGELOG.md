- Semantic Versioning: https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html


## [0.6.9] - 2077-05-01
### Fixed
- Fix all Subnet Proxy issues (as if)


## [0.6.8-beta] - 2026-09-03
### Added
- Prevent redstone updates from triggering unnecessary capability scans on adjacent tiles for Interfaces, if the actual tiles have not changed.
- Add right-click to insert compatible upgrades directly into interfaces/subnet proxies.
- Add Ctrl-A/Ctrl-C/Ctrl-V support to the Max Slot Size text field.
- Add a config to change the default +/- 1/10/100/1000 offset buttons to different values.
- Add a config to use fixed values instead of offsets for the Max Slot Size buttons.
- Allow Interfaces and Subnet Proxies to restore upgrades from the player's inventory when restoring from a memory card, if the upgrades are missing from the interface/proxy itself. This allows to copy filters and upgrades from one interface to another without having to manually insert the cards. Pull/Push cards have their settings restored on top of being inserted, meaning you do not need to have the specific configuration in the player's inventory, just the card itself.
- Add a warning badge on the Pull/Push Card button when a filtered slot is too small to sustain the configured interface/card throughput.

### Fixed
- Fix the Clear Filters button not applying in I/O and Universal Interfaces.
- Fix Subnet Proxy not properly initializing when adding the first filters (resulting in nothing being forwarded until reloaded).
- Fix Void Overflow Card not sending counter-deltas to the network, causing ghost items (as the network doesn't know the items were voided).
- Fix GUIs not exposing the fake slots for JEI interactions (i.e., bookmarking).

### Changed
- Add part recipes for Combined and I/O Interfaces, matching the existing full-block recipes.
- Change default max slot size from Max Long to Max Int, because *some* pack devs cannot be assed to change THIS ONE config value and then I get harassed by assholes for "balance" reasons. Be happy I didn't hard-cap it to Max Int altogether!


## [0.6.7-beta2] - 2026-08-11
### Added
- Add a manual refresh button to interface GUIs so the current tab can immediately push/pull all content to the network, including Pull/Push Card operations.

### Fixed
- Fix TOP integration crashing on dedicated servers due to TOP only being registered client-side.


## [0.6.7-beta] - 2026-08-07
### Added
- Expand WAILA and The One Probe block tooltips beyond interface timings, including filter counts, hidden behavior toggles, and current pull/push card I/O sides for interfaces, exposed pattern summaries for the Compacting Pattern Exposer, and channel/filter mode summaries for Subnet Proxies.

### Fixed
- Fix performance regression in Compacting Cell, where the cell would try rebuilding the compacting chain on every single call instead of genuine changes.

### Changed
- Slightly change how push/pull card treats "keep quantity" field input, to be less eager about reformatting the field while typing.


## [0.6.6-beta3] - 2026-07-27
### Fixed
- Add shift right-click an EMC Cell on an EMC Link to copy the EMC Link's filter into the EMC Cell, for easier transition.
- Fix EMC Cells not opening in CELLS' JEI cell viewer.
- Fix some JEI areas (like history) not being able to Quick Add.


## [0.6.6-beta2] - 2026-07-25
### Added
- Add WAILA and The One Probe lines for interface timing, including the effective AE2-network import/export interval, per-card adjacent pull/push interval details, and transfer quantities.
- Optimize Compacting Card's compacting chain check on the hot path.

### Changed
- Reformulate some tooltip lines to be clearer.


## [0.6.6-beta] - 2026-07-21
### Fixed
- Fix item-based Interfaces voiding buffered overflow when a disconnected export slot is clicked (extraction by hand) after lowering its max slot size.


## [0.6.5-beta] - 2026-07-08
### Fixed
- Fix Import/Export Interfaces loading filters from memory cards in the wrong order.


## [0.6.4-beta5] - 2026-07-07
### Fixed
- Fix Subnet Proxy sometimes loading with an empty front-side view after a restart, by forcing a fresh relist when load-time front-grid churn invalidates the proxy's snapshot baseline before the final network is ready.
- Fix Subnet Proxy forwarding deltas from devices it has not yet listed (e.g., a Storage Bus or ME Drive that is still initializing), which could cause reconciliation to fail and prevent the "true" deltas from being forwarded to the front grid, resulting in missing items in the front grid, or cause the proxy to forward ghost items when the ME Drive finishes initializing.


## [0.6.4-beta4] - 2026-07-06
### Added
- Add thorough debug tracing for Subnet Proxy's network events, hidden behind the `-Dcells.trace.subnetproxy.updateflow=true` JVM flag. This will log the flow of events through EVERY proxy, which is A LOT of logs, so DO NOT ENABLE IT unless you are debugging the proxy and know what you're doing!

### Fixed
- Maybe fix some Subnet Proxy race conditions in network initialization, resulting in deltas being duplicated (ghost items for some items) or not being forwarded (items not showing up on the front grid).


## [0.6.4-beta3] - 2026-07-01
### Fixed
- Mitigate performance issues with 0.6.4-beta2's more heavy-handed reconciliation, in the force-update path.


## [0.6.4-beta2] - 2026-06-29
### Fixed
- Fix Subnet Proxy showing stale items after a partitioned Storage Bus rebuilds, which could leave items visible-but-unextractable and later double-count them on the front network. The cost of force-updates has been increased (due to more heavy-handed reconciliation for correctness' sake), but the steady-state cost should be about the same as before.


## [0.6.4-beta] - 2026-06-28
### Fixed
- Fix Subnet Proxy keeping removed back-grid storage reachable when AE2 reports the disconnect only as storage deltas instead of the normal cell-array update path, such as broken drives or storage buses retargeting away from their previous inventory.


## [0.6.3-beta2] - 2026-06-17
### Fixed
- Fix crash during complex networks' initialization, due to coordinator's election logic (what determines which proxy should forward which events) triggering chained initializations (re-entering the coordinator's code while it's still initializing).
- Harden the sources handling of Subnet Proxy against stale sources that could have become null (and crashing the instance).


## [0.6.3-beta] - 2026-06-16
### Added
- Add textures for IO Interfaces, Compacting Pattern Exposer, Insertion Card, and EMC Cell.
- Add an EMC Cell reported-amount config in CELLS so the visible stack size no longer depends on ProjectEX's external cap and can be set up to Long.MAX_VALUE.
- Add targeted Subnet Proxy diagnostics: a rate-limited warning when the proxy detects a failed extract while the item is still listed, plus `/inspectSubnetProxy` to inspect the looked-at proxy's live state and last detected mismatch. Warnings and fault-recording are gated behind an opt-in config, to allow toggling it on only when needed. Faults originate from ghost items or unextractable items, but the exact cause may not come from the proxy itself. Some things may misreport content (e.g., Essentia Storage Bus) or have items that are visible but not extractable (e.g., EMC Link without enough EMC).

### Fixed
- Fix Subnet Proxy occasionally keeping stale availability after back-grid topology changes, by rebuilding from AE2-active providers and forcing a front-grid refresh when the proxy's published source/election surface actually changes.
- Fix Subnet Proxy coordinator maybe not properly refreshing after a rebuild, causing diamond topologies to report the same deltas (ghost content). The coordinator is responsible for deciding which proxy should forward which events in a subnet.
- Fix parallel Subnet Proxies between the same two grids collapsing to one front's channel/filter config; the elected representative now unions direct parallel fronts so visibility no longer depends on which one wins election.
- Fix Storage Buses exposed by Subnet Proxies being stale after rebuild.
- Fix partially partitioned Configurable Cells refusing to extract stored items and fluids that were no longer listed in the partition filter.


## [0.6.2-alpha3] - 2026-06-06
### Fixed
- Fix paged interface tank/storage clicks (pour/fill) using the wrong slot indices, which blocked interacting with page 2+ contents.
- Fix standalone Essentia Interfaces hiding filters past the first page.
- Fix some jank interactions with the Configurable Cell's component slots, resulting in voiding components or being able to insert invalid components, in some cases. All cases should be fixed, now.
- Fix Configurable Cell's warnings/errors using the old translation keys.
- Remove AE2's hotbar handling (1-9 under F keys) from GUIs, where they may conflict with other numeric fields or keybinds.


## [0.6.2-alpha2] - 2026-05-26
### Added
- Add JEI recipe transfer support for Import, Export, Universal, and IO interfaces. All interface GUIs expose a shared toggle that saves whether Import interfaces receive recipe inputs or outputs, and IO interfaces route their Import/Export tabs from that same preference.
- Add JEI recipe transfer support for Creative Cell filters, with the toggle swapping whether JEI adds recipe inputs or outputs.
- Add the EMC Cell, a ProjectEX-backed AE2 storage cell that exposes partitioned items at a fixed count, converts inserts into buffered EMC, and supports upgrade tiers for larger filter counts.

### Fixed
- Fix Compacting Cells preserving the raw stored base-unit count when a tier card rebuild changes the chain depth, which caused decompression cards to show too few items after being added to a non-empty cell.


## [0.6.2-alpha] - 2026-05-22
### Added
- Add a storage-cell component swap recipe that converts one CELLS cell into another CELLS cell family while returning the replaced component, and rejects swaps that would lose contents or leave incompatible upgrades installed.
- Add the Compacting Pattern Exposer, a block that turns ghost-filtered compacting conversions into instant AE2 processing patterns.


## [0.6.1-alpha4] - 2026-05-18
### Fixed
- Fix Compacting Cells not properly updating the compacting chain when partitioned again in a Cell Workbench. This is a regression from a previous fix (probably 0.5.13-beta).

### Changed
- Change the Subnet Proxy's front texture to use the arrow on all sides, instead of just top.


## [0.6.1-alpha3] - 2026-05-17
### Fixed
- Fix IO/Universal Interface not handling the Network Tool's Toolbox properly.
- Fix Subnet Proxy having the Network Tool's Toolbox's slots misaligned with the texture.


## [0.6.1-alpha2] - 2026-05-08
### Added
- Add support for shift-clicking, quick-adding, dragging from JEI, and pouring into interface slots for Recovery Containers (instead of being treated as the orb item).
- Add interoperability for all the interface types between each others (e.g., you can export the filters of an Item Interface to an Universal Interface or an IO Item Interface, and vice versa). The direction and type must match (will only apply what matches if more than 1 type is supported, e.g., Universal Interface).
- Add Memory Card support for Subnet Proxy, so they can import filters from AE2 Item/Fluid/Gas/Essentia Storage Buses and other Subnet Proxies.

### Fixed
- Fix WAILA/TOP status overlays showing Subnet Proxies as offline and Interface blocks with no power/channel state line.
- Fix the memory card "save filters" shortcut not handling I/O interfaces.


## [0.6.1-alpha] - 2026-05-07
### Added
- Add a public API for the Subnet Proxy and Interfaces to allow other mods to interact with them without resorting to NBT manipulation or reflection.

### Fixed
- Fix rare Subnet Proxy deadlock (server tick freeze) when 2 subnet proxies published the same network event at the same time during a full re-build event.
- (Maybe) Fix Item I/O Interface automation exposing import and export slots on top of each other, which could block pipes from extracting from the export side if it has more items than the import side.


## [0.6.0-alpha2] - 2026-05-04
### Added
- Add crafting recipes for the Subnet Proxy Back/Front parts, and the Insertion Card upgrade.

### Fixed
- Fix Subnet Proxy causing severe server-tick lag in chains/diamonds: back-grid cell-array updates no longer force a full re-listing of every cell handler on the front grid. Cell-array updates may be triggered by any change in the back grid (e.g., a storage bus polling, a cell going from full to non-full, etc.).
- Fix Subnet Proxy gas/essentia deltas not participating in cross-hub UUID dedup: gas and essentia channels now use the same forwarding path as items/fluids, so chained/diamond proxy topologies dedup gas/essentia events identically.
- Fix Subnet Proxy leaking gas/essentia listener registrations on Grid A monitors when the back grid changes or the proxy is removed.
- Fix texture of Subnet Proxy in item form.


## [0.6.0-alpha] - 2026-05-03
### Added
- Add the Subnet Proxy (front/back), 2 parts that allow to create a unidirectional subnet (passthrough) with optional filtering. The filtering is done in pages, with each capacity card allowing for an additional page of 63 filters. All 4 types are combined in the filter, with a button to cycle which type should be encoded on drag-and-drop/shift-click/quick-add. The Subnet Proxy will only expose the content of the network it is connected to (no showing looping content). The local content is propagated to the connected network + 1 level of subnet proxies, allowing for A -> B -> A -> C -> A setups where C is aware B without looping to A.
- Subnet Proxy Insertion Card: when installed, the proxy also forwards matching items in the reverse direction (front-grid → back-grid), letting items inserted on the front side be pushed back into the back-grid storage if they pass the filter and priority routing.
- Add a config to set the number of upgrade slots for Subnet Proxies (1-24).
- Add IO Interfaces for all types (except combined). These interfaces combine Import and Export as 2 inventories (avoiding interferences).
- Add an Essentia Container Blacklist config to specify tile entities by registry ID, preventing the Essentia Interface's Push/Pull card from interacting with buggy containers.
- Add protective checks for possible null aspects from outside mods in the Essentia Interface, to prevent crashes. This should never happen if the other mods do their job properly, but Thaumcraft addons are known to be all kinds of janky.
- Add a toggle arrow button before the title in all Interface GUIs to show/hide the Controls Help panel. The visibility state is persisted across sessions.
- Filter slots (Item/Fluid/Gas/Essentia interfaces and Subnet Proxy) now show the full hover tooltip of the underlying content, matching what JEI shows on hover (including lines added by other mods). Click hints are appended at the bottom. JEI is preferred when loaded; vanilla item tooltips and a display-name fallback are used otherwise.

### Fixed
- Fix Memory Card wiping upgrades in the receiving interface when transferring data.
- Fix Controls Help being able to go out of the screen when the screen is too small, causing a crash.
- Fix "Add to filter" keybind not working with bookmarks from recent HEI versions.
- Fix Combined Interfaces in Adaptive Mode not waking up when adding the first filter (e.g. on a freshly-placed Export-side IO Interface), leaving the interface idle until another network event happened.


## [0.5.15-beta] - 2026-04-15
### Fixed
- Fix Memory Card not saving filters of Essentia Interfaces.
- Fix Combined Interface crashing on opening when Mekanism/Thaumcraft wasn't there.

### Added
- Add a line in Interfaces' Controls Help to clarify Memory Card use.

### Changed
- Re-texture Push/Pull cards slightly.


## [0.5.14-beta2] - 2026-04-13
### Fixed
- Fix crash with push card and Thaumatorium when no recipe is set.

### Added
- Add I/O Interface for all resource types (Item, Fluid, Gas, Essentia). Combines an Import and Export Interface into a single block, with the same filtering and upgrade capabilities as the Import/Export Interfaces.


## [0.5.14-beta] - 2026-04-12
### Fixed
- Fix some fields missing from the in-game config.
- Fix severe performance regression in interface client sync: replace per-ItemStack GZIP compression with lightweight NBT encoding, and move indiscriminate client sync of all interfaces to only the one GUI the player has open.
- Fix max slot size values under 1000 being silently discarded.
- Fix `/inspectSlots` only showing the first detected capability instead of all of them.
- Fix push/pull-card affecting all sides of a parts, instead of just the facing side.
- Fix push/pull-card not registering containers at world start, in some cases.
- Fix pull card voiding items after pushing to network.

### Added
- Add Universal Import/Export Interface, variants that combine all 4 types into 1.
- Add config to switch interfaces to non-animated textures.
- Add per-slot max capacity override.
- Add message overlay system for in-game feedback (success/error/warning messages above the hotbar).

### Changed
- Change the slot display from "current" to "current / max", to show how full the slot is.
- Change "flattened" config to categories
- Change `/inspectSlots` to show all capabilities of a block sequentially instead of only the first match.


## [0.5.13-beta2] - 2026-04-09
### Fixed
- Fix Export Essentia Interface exposing 0 essentia when polled, resulting in no essentia being exported.
- Fix negative buttons in Max Slot Size GUI resetting the value to 1 (instead of adding the negative delta).
- Fix auto-pull/push card disabling network IO when no adjacent inventory is present (e.g., removing all chests adjacent to the interface would stop it from importing/exporting to the ME network altogether).
- Fix Import/Export Interface's Controls Help not having a JEI exclusion area.

### Added
- Optimize the hot path for all cells.


## [0.5.13-beta] - 2026-04-06
### Fixed
- Fix (long overdue) issues with the Compacting Cells :
  - Fix possible overflows in compression chain with 10+ tiers.
  - Fix possible race condition in compression chain handling.
  - Fix some cases where adding/removing a Compression/Decompression card would not update the compression chain, while resizing the chain array (resulting in stale or incorrect chain being used).

### Note
- After removing a Compression/Decompression card, the compression chain may not automatically shrink until the cell is reinserted or another Compression/Decompression card is inserted. This should be harmless, as the next chunk load or force update should reload the cell. It may allow to use 1 card for multiple cells, but if you're that dedicated, I will not stop you...


## [0.5.12-beta2] - 2026-04-06
### Added
- Add in-interface GUI for Pull/Push Cards. This way, you can configure the card without removing it and inserting it back.


## [0.5.12-beta] - 2026-04-05
### Fixed
- Fix Fluid (Hyper-Density/Configurable), Gas (Configurable), and Essentia (Configurable) partitions using Item config, which allowed items to be encoded even if they were not valid for this specific cell type. Items are now correctly validated at encoding time. Re-encoding should not be required for cells that already have a valid partition, but it's always good to do it in order to remove invalid items.

### Added
- Optimize some Push/Pull Card logic.
- Optimize getAvailableItems (protoStack caching and NBT bypass) for all cell types.
- Mention Push/Pull Cards in the controls help widget and the README.
- Add the /inspectSlots command, to show details about the slots of the block the player is looking at.

### Changed
- Move the Controls Help from bottom of the GUI to centered vertically.

### Technical
- Adaptive Mode is set to 1s (20 ticks) when a Push/Pull Card is present, to prevent excessive ticking and network I/O. The card can tick faster (e.g., every tick), but network I/O is throttled to a set minimum to prevent lag. Considering normal Adaptive mode can 
- External Capacilities' slots for Keep Quantity are now queried once instead of once per item in filter.
- IItemRepository is now queried instead of IItemHandler when the TE supports it.
- Slots' content and space is now cached between IItemHandler calls (in the same tick), to avoid redundant queries.


## [0.5.12-alpha2] - 2026-04-02
### Changed
- Clean tooltips to better convey intents and behaviors.
- Change the recipe of Equal Distribution and Compression/Decompression cards, as it's more a configuration than balance.


## [0.5.12-alpha] - 2026-03-31
### Added
- Implement Auto-Pull and Auto-Push Card functionality for all resource interfaces (Item, Fluid, Gas, Essentia). Cards can be configured with transfer quantity, interval, and keep-quantity to automatically move resources between adjacent inventories and the ME network buffer.
- Optimize the I/O both from and to the Interfaces.


## [0.5.11-beta2] - 2026-03-30
### Fixed
- Fix Essentia Storage Bus having caching issues with our interfaces (this is a bug from Thaumic Energistics). This fix makes the Essentia Interface itself handle all the work for the Bus and force changes onto it. This will not fix *any* other block you put the Bus on, either fix the Storage Bus or do the work yourself.
- Fix Interface tiles not showing on Network Tool.
- Fix migration of Export Fluid Interfaces from 0.5.9-rc.

### Changed
- Slight changes in Max Slot Size's typing behavior.


## [0.5.11-beta] - 2026-03-28
### Fixed
- Fix some Upgrades not showing anymore in JEI/Creative Tab.

### Added
- Increase the max slot size limit from 2.1B to 9.2 quintillion (Long.MAX_VALUE), to allow for really high throughput I/O or long waiting times.
- Make max slot size GUI more readable.
- Add Items to the Recovery Orb for quantities above Max Int (cannot hold more than max int in an ItemStack).
- Add a config option to limit the max slot size that players are allowed to set, as a way to balance the potential "bottomless storage" aspect of the interfaces.
- Add a config option for the minimum polling rate, to allow reducing the strain on servers.
- Add recipes for Gas/Essentia Import/Export Interfaces.
- Add Auto-pull/Auto-push cards for Import/Export Interfaces, which automatically pull/push items from/to adjacent inventories. The pull/push interval is set in the card's GUI and can be different for each card. The logic is not yet implemented and will come in a future update.


## [0.5.10-beta3] - 2026-03-27
### Fixed
- Fix incorrect use of server-side I18n on several places.
- Minor tooltip fix.


## [0.5.10-beta2] - 2026-03-26
### Added
- Make Adaptive Mode more efficient by only forcing the wake-up when we are sleeping (not just slower). This means a somewhat constant stream of item will not ask the network to wake up at every insertion, relying instead on AE2's adaptive rates. "Fixed Polling" is not affected by this change (as it never "sleeps").
- Add AE2 ToolNetworkTool support for Import/Export Interfaces (Upgrade Cards holder).

### Fixed
- Fix Import Interfaces not waking up when resources are inserted in via GUI after switching to Adaptive mode.
- Fix client-side refresh of interface slots not sending NBT (losing the NBT of potions, for example), causing the client to display incorrect information.
- Fix Content Recovery Orb not handling fluid NBT.
- Fix crash when JEI is not present (missing some checks).
- Fix crash when Storage Drawers is present (double IItemRepository initialization).


## [0.5.10-beta] - 2026-03-26
### Added
- Optimize the Storage Bus on Item Interface interaction (only ITEM) to be at the same performance level as a drawer wall (without the drawer wall sync overhead).
- Add Creative Fluid Cell, the fluid counterpart of the Creative Cell, with the same behavior but for fluids.
- Add quick-add keybind handling for the Creative Cell, like is done for Import/Export interfaces.
- Add Gas Creative Cell.
- Add Gas Import/Export interface.
- Add Essentia Creative Cell.
- Add Essentia Import/Export interface. It can be used directly on Thaumatorium, Infusion, and probably also with Essentia hatches.
- Add Recovery Orb item, an item that is dropped when a non-item interface is broken/shrunk and cannot send its contents back to the network.

### Fixed
- Fix Import/Export Fluid Interfaces not accepting the same fluid with different NBT (e.g. potions).
- Fix some blocks using the wrong texture.
- Fix inconsistencies with the Memory Card (now tested on all Full-block vs Part).

### Changed
- Make the Creative Cell accept and void content that they produce, acting as both a producer and a sink, to avoid issues with items not being able to return to the network because we extracted them from the cell but they can't be inserted back.
- Reject Cells as valid targets for Creative Cells.
- Retouch component textures to be easier to work with (more unified). The wave animation has been removed to be reworked later (was nearly imperceptible).

### Technical
- Unify Import/Export Interfaces (tiles and parts) even more, to allow for less tedious addition of Gas/Essentia types.
- Unify Creative Cells for the same purpose.
- Unify all slot behaviors (Sneak-click, left-click, right-click, quick-add, JEI add, rendering, etc.)
- Allow Item Interface to provide IItemRepository instead of only IItemHandler, for less capabilities overhead.
- Replace backed textures (~150) by overlaid layers with tinting. Any new cell type would not add new textures, only requiring tinting support in the code. This shaves ~300kB from the (compressed) JAR.


## [0.5.9-rc] - 2026-03-17
### Fixed
- Fix bug where the Import/Export Interface may never wake up in Adaptive mode (polling rate = 0) when there was nothing to import/export and the grid was cut (power loss or not enough channels) then reconnected.
- Fix placing disassembled Import/Export Interfaces resetting them to default settings and filters.
- Fix right-click then left-click on an Export Interface slot putting (Slot size - 32) items in the player's hand, instead of a stack/half a stack.
- Unify the logic of Import/Export Interfaces, squashing a few minor bugs and inconsistencies.
- Mitigate base AE2-UEL crash when handling oversized stack counts in slotClick for some specific mods configurations.

### Changed
- Change disassembly behavior to keep upgrades for Import/Export Interfaces, so that filters are not lost due to capacity shrinkage. The upgrades are still dropped on breaking and the inventory is dropped on both actions.


## [0.5.8] - 2026-03-16
### Added
- Optimize oredict matching for the Ore Dictionary Card, from O(n*m) to O(m) where n is the number of ore dict entries in the cell and m is the number of ore dict entries for the input item. This should mainly affect cases with a big compacting chain (e.g., using Compression/Decompression Cards). m is usually small (most items have 0-2 ore dict entries), so this should be a significant improvement in those cases, while not causing much overhead in the general case.
- Add whitelist and blacklist files for the Oredict matching of the Ore Dictionary Card, to allow modpacks to control which ore dictionary entries are valid for the card.
- Extend the list of default Thaumcraft and Mekanism components for the Configurable Cell.

### Fixed
- Fix the Ore Dictionary Card being too lenient in its matching, allowing every oredict <-> oredict match without restriction, which could be exploited in some cases (e.g., any dye -> lapis or any log -> any other log). The card now matches only via whitelist/blacklist in the config file (defaults to bundled if not present). This matches what the Storage Drawers's Conversion Upgrade does, and should be less exploitable. The whitelist/blacklist can be configured by modpacks to allow/deny specific entries if needed.

### Changed
- Move the default configurable_components.cfg file to config/cells. The config/ path is still valid, but the new location takes precedence if both exist.


## [0.5.7] - 2026-03-13
### Added
- Add a config to control the number of upgrade slots for each cell type.
- Increase the default number of upgrade slots for all cell types from 2 to 4.


## [0.5.6] - 2026-03-13
### Added
- Add shift + right-click to set a Creative Cell filter from inventory.
- Optimize the Creative Cell. Shouldn't make a huge difference in most cases, but who knows.

### Fixed
- Fixed Creative Cell not notifying the grid the items are not consumed. It's not that big of a deal as it has a ton of items, but could cause problem in some fringe cases.


## [0.5.5] - 2026-03-13
### Added
Add Creative Cell, a Cell that can only be configured in Creative mode, and exposes 4.6 quintillion of each set item.


## [0.5.4] - 2026-03-08
### Fixed
- Fix Configurable Cells' weird behavior with max types (no max showing -1)


## [0.5.3] - 2026-03-07
### Fixed
- (Really) fix the mod crashing on some versions of Cleanroom due to blocks registry not being mapped yet.


## [0.5.2] - 2026-03-06
### Added
- Add NAE2 JEI Cell View feature as a built-in feature. It does not depend on NAE2 because hooking into it requires either:
  - Heavy use of mixins to NAE2.
  - Tagging our cells as IStorageCell<?>, which then overrides our custom handlers and break the cells. Compacting loses compacting power, Hyper-Density loses the extra space, etc.


## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-05
### Added
- Add Oredict card support for Compacting Cells. The cell will convert the items into the partitioned item based on the Oredict entry.

### Fixed
- Fix item filters not being able to be set on page 2+ for Import Interfaces placed before 0.5.0

### Changed
- Remove NBT size for Compacting Cells, as they shouldn't have any issue with large NBT sizes, storing only 1 "real" item.
- Lower the warning threshold for NBT size to 100kB, as 1MB is probably already too late for most cases, and it's better to be safe and warn earlier. That's still only 20 cells away from the 2MB packet size limit, but will see how it goes in practice.


## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-04
### Added
- Add Export Interfaces: same as Import Interfaces but for exposing items/fluids from the ME network to outside piping. They have the same filtering and upgrade capabilities as Import Interfaces, but work in reverse.
- Add clear button to Import/Export interfaces. Clears the current filters (if possible).
- Add Capacity Card support to Import/Export Interfaces. Each capacity card adds a page of 36 additional filter/storage slots (up to 4 cards for 5 pages total = 180 slots). Removing a capacity card returns items from deleted pages to the network and clears those filters.


## [0.4.11] - 2026-03-02
### Added
- Add additional Memory Card keybind to include filters when saving a card.
- Add keybind to quickly add the hovered item to the first free filter slot in the Import Interfaces.
- Add better explanations for how to best use the Import Interface in the buttons tooltip and the controls help widget.
- Add a tooltip for components that are compatible with the Configurable Cell, to make it more clear which ones can be used in it.
- Add NBT size and a warning for cells with large NBT sizes, to make it more clear when a cell might come close to the packet size limit and cause issues with the network.
- Split the Configurable Cell's types limit (config) between the different data types (item, fluid, essentia, gas), to allow more flexibility in configuring it for different use cases.
- Allow configurable cells to have the types limit set in the GUI, to trade-off between max types and max capacity per type without needing to change the config and reload the world.
- Allow disabling the NBT size calculation in config.


## [0.4.10] - 2026-03-01
### Fixed
- Fix gradle not including the API by default.


## [0.4.9] - 2026-02-29
### Changed
- Make MixinBooter optional. The storage cells will only stack to 1 if mixins are not enabled, preventing duplication exploits in ME Chest/Workbench.


## [0.4.8] - 2026-02-28
### Fixed
- Fix a weird crash with some versions of Cleanroom (Material.IRON not existing)


## [0.4.7] - 2026-02-28
### Fixed
- Fix Import Interface's slots not being aligned with filtered slots (slots with no filter are still not exposed)


## [0.4.6] - 2026-02-27
### Added
- Add Essentia and Gas support for Configurable Cells (with textures for all the supported sizes: 1k, 4k, ..., 1g, 2g).
- Add support for Essentia and Gas in /fillCell.
- Add recipes for combining the Configurable Cell and the component directly.
- Add some warnings for custom components in the configurable_components.cfg.

### Changed
- Harmonize Configurable Cells.

### Technical
- Refactor the codebase to share the common logic between the various cell types.


## [0.4.5] - 2026-02-25
### Added
- Add support for downloading and uploading Import Interface settings to memory cards and dismantled blocks.
- Add part variants to both Import Interfaces.


## [0.4.4] - 2026-02-24
### Changed
- Finish updating placeholder textures to (less placeholder) assets. Proper assets will come (probably, maybe, who knows, lol).


## [0.4.3] - 2026-02-23
### Added
- Add stricter checks for upgrades being applied (instead of all custom cards).

### Changed
- Update textures from placeholders to proper (still somewhat placeholder) assets.


## [0.4.2] - 2026-02-22
### Fixed
- Fix empty Configurable Cell not displaying correctly in ME Chest/ME Drive, due to reporting the wrong status.
- Fix Configurable Cell sometimes voiding invalid items if spammed madly on the Component slot.
- Fix Configurable Cell using the wrong calculation for fluids, allowing 1000x more than expected, and reporting 250x the bytes.
- Fix Import Interface's max slot size not working properly with some piping methods. It now always exposes an empty dummy slot at index 0.

### Changed
- Make Compression/Decompression cards cheaper, requiring an Overclocked Processor instead of a Singularity one.


## [0.4.1] - 2026-02-21
### Added
- Add Fluid Import Interface: a filtered interface that imports fluids into the ME network. Accepts fluid containers (buckets, etc.) as filter ghost items and routes matching fluids to the network. Supports overflow and trash-unselected upgrade cards.
- Add chat warnings explaining why a filter cannot be added or removed for both Import Interface and Fluid Import Interface.

### Fixed
- Fix polling rate over-ticking for each polling rate change (until world reload), due to the ticking requests not being properly unregistered on AE2's side.
- Fix Compacting Cell not properly updating the compacting chain when adding/removing a compression/decompression card after partitioning the cell.
- Fix ME Chest and Cell Workbench accepting stacked cells, which causes duplication when the NBT is written to the stack. Mixins are used to set the relevant slots' max stack size to 1, like is the case for ME Drives.
- Fix Configurable Cell using only 1 component for the whole stack, instead of 1 component per cell, resulting in component duplication/voiding.


## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-19
### Added
- Add Configurable ME Storage Cell: a universal cell that accepts an item/fluid ME Storage Component (AE2, NAE2, CrazyAE) to define its capacity and storage type. Features built-in equal distribution, configurable per-type capacity limits via GUI, and component hot-swapping.
- Add player message when trying to disassemble a cell with content, explaining the need to empty it first.

### Fixed
- Fix HD Item and HD Fluid cells having a fixed bytes-per-type overhead that breaks when max types exceeds 128. Overhead is now dynamically computed as 50% of total bytes, supporting both config and Equal Distribution Card limits.


## [0.3.8] - 2026-02-18
### Fixed
- Fix Import Interface not allowing items with the same ID and metadata but different NBT in filters, due NBT collision when checking for duplicates.


## [0.3.7] - 2026-02-16
### Fixed
- Fix items with the same ID and metadata but different NBT, incorrectly merging in hyper-density cells (e.g., Thaumcraft vis crystals).


## [0.3.6] - 2026-02-15
### Fixed
- Fix Import Interface's Polling Rate and Max Slot Size using short int instead of int, causing overflow and negative values when set above 32767.


## [0.3.5] - 2026-02-14
### Changed
- Improve the tooltips to clarify some behaviors.
- Tweak the Import Interface top and bottom.


## [0.3.4] - 2026-02-14
### Added
- Add configurable polling rate to Import Interface, allowing users to set a fixed interval for importing items instead of relying on AE2's adaptive rates. This way, you can stock 100k items to send to the network every hour, for example.

### Fixed
- Fix some stale filter on world load for the Import Interface, which caused it to not import items until the filter was updated.


## [0.3.3] - 2026-02-13
### Added
- Add upgrades support for Import Interface: Trash Unselected (voids items that don't match any filter) and Overflow (voids excess items that don't fit in the slot).

### Fixed
- Fix Cells accepting any upgrade, instead of just the custom + standard AE2 ones.

### Changed
- Apply stricter checks for valid filters in the Import Interface. Filters cannot be duplicated or orphaned (having items in the storage slot without a filter).


## [0.3.2] - 2026-02-12
### Fixed
- Fix Cell disassembly overwriting the whole stack to empty, instead of just one cell.


## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-11
### Added
- Add Import Interface texture and fix the recipe.


## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-11
### Added
- Add Import Interface, a block that act as a filtered interface for importing items into the ME network. It needs to be configured to allow specific items, and can be used to export items into the network from machines that don't necessarily have a filtered export capability (Woot, Ultimate Mob Farm, etc). It does not have any exporting or crafting capabilities, and only works as an import interface.

### Fixed
- Fix Hyper-Density Cells being both "full" and "empty" at the same time, due to NBT desync.


## [0.2.5] - 2026-02-10
### Added
- Further optimize all cells by 2-3x, specifically in very high load scenarios (multiple operations in the same tick). /!\ This optimization assumes the network is not doing hacky things and lacks some proper synchronization, so it might cause issues with mods that do that.


## [0.2.4] - 2026-02-09
### Added
- Improve the performance of compacting cells by a factor 4x.


## [0.2.3] - 2026-02-09
### Fixed
- Fix compacting cells not properly computing the chain when paritioned with the lowest tier, causing the compression ratio to be 1 instead of 4 or 9.


## [0.2.2] - 2026-02-08
### Added
- Add Equal Distribution Card without type limit (unbounded card), meaning it inherits the max types from the cell itself. This is useful if you want equal distribution with higher than 63 types (via config).
- Add textures for Hyper-Density Cells (courtesy of archezechiel)

### Fixed
- Fix type limit config not being applied to Hyper-Density Cells.
- Fix Compacting Cell sometimes not properly reporting a change to the network, when used across subnets.


## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-05
### Added
- Add recipes for all processors, cell components, and upgrades
- Add textures for Hyper-Density Compacting/Fluid Cell Components (courtesy of archezekiel)
- Add overflow protection to Compacting Cells
- Add 3x, 6x, 9x, 12x, 15x Compression/Decompression cards for Compacting Cells. The partitioned item determines the compression chain, and the card determines how many tiers can be compressed/decompressed in that chain. It only goes in one direction at a time (compressing or decompressing), depending on the card used.
  - 3x card allows compressing/decompressing up to 3 tiers (e.g., nugget → ingot → block → double block)
  - 6x card allows compressing/decompressing up to 6 tiers
  - 9x card allows compressing/decompressing up to 9 tiers
  - 12x card allows compressing/decompressing up to 12 tiers
  - 15x card allows compressing/decompressing up to 15 tiers

### Fixed
- Fix Compacting Chain not replacing the previous one when partitioned via API
- Fix (?) some issues with Compacting Cells not properly reporting changes in virtual items to the network, until refreshed (e.g., by reinserting the cell)

### Changed
- Remove normal cells, as they didn't bring much value. Other mods already provide larger normal storage cells, and even 1k Hyper-Density Cells are better than 2G normal cells. It has been decided to not use the normal cell components in the crafting recipes for Hyper-Density Cells.


## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-04
### Added
- Add Fluid Hyper-Density Storage Cells: 1k to 1G (multiplying base size by ~2.1B)
- Add Fluid Normal Storage Cells: 64M, 256M, 1G, 2G
- Add fluid support to the `/fillcell` command
- Add textures for 1k to 1G Hyper-Density Storage Components (courtesy of archezekiel)

### Fixed
- Wire all cell idle drain values from the config file (previously hardcoded)
- Fix Overflow Card being too eager and voiding anything that couldn't be inserted, instead of only voiding excess of already stored types
- Fix some overflow issues with Hyper-Density Cells when nearing maximum capacity


## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-01
### Added
- Add Storage Cells for larger capacities:
  - Normal Storage Cells: 64M, 256M, 1G, 2G
  - Hyper-Density Storage Cells: 1k to 1G (multiplying base size by 2.1B)
- Add Compacting Storage Cells that expose compressed/decompressed item forms to the ME network
  - Available in 1k to 16MG sizes
  - Partition an item to set up the compression chain (e.g., Iron Ingot → Iron Block / Iron Nugget)
  - As partition dictates the compression chain, it cannot be changed while items are stored. This also means that items cannot be inserted before partitioning. If partitioned with the Cell Workbench, inserting the partitioned item is required to initialize the chain. If the partition is changed to something else while the cell is not empty, the new partition is reverted back to the previous one.
  - If partitioned from the Cell Terminal (from the Cell Terminal mod), the chain is automatically initialized. Inserting the partitioned item is not required.
  - Virtual conversion: Insert any tier and extract any other tier (e.g., insert nuggets → extract blocks)
  - Storage capacity counts only the main (partitioned) item tier
- Add Compacting Storage Components for crafting Compacting Cells
- Add server-side configuration file with in-game GUI editor
  - Configure max types per cell
  - Configure idle power drain for each cell type
  - Enable/disable individual cell types (Compacting, HD, HD Compacting, Normal)
- Add Void Overflow Card upgrade for storage Cells: voids excess items when the cell is full. Only works with Compacting and Hyper-Density Cells from this mod.
- Add Equal Distribution Card upgrade (7 variants: 1x, 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x, 32x, 63x)
  - Limits the number of types a cell can hold to the card's value
  - Divides total capacity equally among all types
  - Works with Hyper-Density Storage Cells (NOT compatible with Compacting Cells)
- Add `IItemCompactingCell` interface for Compacting Cells' chain initialization
